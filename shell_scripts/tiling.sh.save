# Let's tile some images!
# --root is the dir where the image(s) are located
# --step is the step between tiles, so start a new tile every __ pixels
# --size is the size of the tile in px (always square)
# --output is the dir to write the patches in
## E.g. if step is 100, and size is 100, there's no overlap
## if step is 30, and size 100, then there's overlap. A new 100px tile starts every
## 30 px.
